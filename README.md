# Helmet-Numberplate-Speed Detection

Developed a system for helmet and number plate detection using YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9. Implemented the Deepsort algorithm for speed detection. Achieved a precision of 87%, recall of 90.1%, and mAPscore@50% of 90.4% for YOLOv7. Integrated Tesseract OCR for number plate recognition and used HTML, CSS, and Django for frontend and backend development.
